# Comp 561 Final Project

## Introduction
The goal of this study is to investigate how we can effectively use open-source single-cell RNA-seq analysis tools such as Scanpy to identify highly expressed genes in ovarian cancer cells and to dissect tumor heterogeneity within our data set. 

## Ovarian Cancer
The improvement of the genomic understanding of histological subtypes of ovarian cancer extremely important to researchers as ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. As ovarian cancer is a disease that can be subdivided into several histological subtypes, there is strong tumour heterogeneity - meaning that the tumour tissue consists of cell populations with different expression profiles. This heterogeneity leads to differences in growth rate and drug sensitivity, causing not only cause tumour recurrence but also having an effect on clinical treatment. Therefore, an in-depth study of this tumour heterogeneity will provide insight into potential targeted therapy for these tumours. Specifically we look into High Grade Serious Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) which arises mainly from the ovarian surface epithelium or the falopian tube epithelium.  

Although bulk RNA sequencing analysis has been commonly used in the past, single-cell sequencing technology has become a widely used method to study developmental and tumour biology. Analyzing the single-cell can provide insights into the heterogeneity of tumours that bulk analysis simply cannot.
